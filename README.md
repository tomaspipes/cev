In this project, we'll create a simple Java Program 
The program will feature three games, each done by a different individual.

- Game 1 : Hangman by: @Sylviia1
- Game 2 : Guess the number by:  @melotone04
- Game 3 : TicTacToe by: @tomaspipes

Have fun, and nice games.

To execute the application, run the following command in the terminal:
```bash
javac -d bin -cp src $(find src -name "*.java") main/*.java
java -cp bin main.Main
```

Or simply execute the `run.sh` script by running the following command in the terminal:
```bash
./run.sh
```
